# Resource.log()

This project was created during the School of Code bootcamp in an agile team. Our goal was to create a web app which would be a one-stop shop for all resources shared during the course and avoid losing important information on Slack. 

We created two login routes to differentiate between coaches who would have admin permissions to add new resources and bootcampers who would simply be able to view these resources by week.
